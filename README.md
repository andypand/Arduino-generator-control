# Arduino-generator-control
Arduino based genreator controller, based on 328PB chip.  Makes use of SIM800 modem for comms.

Realising what github is here for, I've set about creating a low power arduino for various projects and while Im at it included my gernerator controller to make things more interesting.

I AM NO EXPERT and am here to learn.  Please critisize approprately.

The NANO will make use of [MCUdude Minicore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) and will be Flashed with this bootloader.  There is a lot going on with this core and really lets out the flexability of the 328 chip and advise to check it out.

I choose to use the 328PB bacause it superior to the standard 328P at the same cost point.
